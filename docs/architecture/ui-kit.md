# ui_kit

This page covers the rules every `ui_kit` widget follows. `ui_kit` is the single owner of the Ledger design system, and its place among the modules is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#features).

## Tokens and colour

- `ui_kit` owns the colour, spacing, radius, stroke and type tokens, plus every widget that paints them.
- Colour is for job status, plus one stamp ink for what waits on the user.
- The window is a gridded desk in both themes, and anything read in rows sits on paper.

## Interaction states

- Every clickable kit widget shows the pointing hand, a hover, a pressed and a focus state.
- It paints its own disabled look, with the reason on hover.
- A picked row or card adds an ink edge to the hover fill.

## What can be selected

Labels are not selectable, so a click on a row's text picks the row. Only these can be selected and copied:

- documents, code boxes, alerts and load errors;
- your replies;
- Claude's questions shown whole, and their choices;
- the research note, the archived posting and drafts;
- the folder path in Settings › General.

None of them sits inside something clickable.

## Gallery snapshots

`tests/ui_kit_gallery.rs` snapshots every component in both themes.
